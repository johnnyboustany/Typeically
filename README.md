## Typeically Instructions:

###    To run the Typeically program:
    
        1. Download the CORS UnBlock extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en). Activate it by making sure the yellow light on the bug icon is visible.

        2. In one terminal:
            cd frontend
            cd type-client
            npm start

        3. In another terminal:
            cd backend
            ./run --gui

###     To test the Typeically program:
    
        To run the Junit and Selenium tests:
            cd backend
            mvn test

        **IMPORTANT**:
            - Make sure you activate the CORS UnBlock extension in the browser when the selenium tabs open
            - No need to download the extension for testing, it is preloaded.
